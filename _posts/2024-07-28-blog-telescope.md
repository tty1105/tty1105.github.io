In this blog, I list and introduce some telescopes working in the centimeter/millimeter/sub-millimeter/infrared bands whose calls for proposal are open to Chinese researchers. Please note that the avialable instruments may change in different semester. Please refer to the official websites for more detailed and accurate information. 

## cm/mm/sub-mm Telescopes
* Telescopes in China
  1. Purple Mountain Observatory at Delingha ([PMOD](http://www.radioast.nsdc.cn/shiyongzhinan.php)): A **13.7m** telescope works at approximately **85-115 GHz** with a velocity resolution of ~0.2 km/s, covering most of the molecular limes at 3mm band. 
  2. 
* Telescopes in other countries in the northern hemisphere
* Telescopes in other countries in the southern hemisphere
