In this blog, I list and introduce some telescopes working in the centimeter/millimeter/sub-millimeter/infrared bands whose calls for proposal are open to Chinese researchers. Please note that the avialable instruments may change in different semester. Please refer to the official websites for more detailed and accurate information.
