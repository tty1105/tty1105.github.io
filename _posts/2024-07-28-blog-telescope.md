In this blog, I list and introduce some telescopes working in the centimeter/millimeter/sub-millimeter/infrared bands whose calls for proposal are open to Chinese researchers. Please note that the avialable instruments may change in different semester. Please refer to the official websites for more detailed and accurate information. 

# cm/mm/sub-mm Telescopes
### Telescopes in China
1. Purple Mountain Observatory at Delingha ([PMOD](http://www.radioast.nsdc.cn/shiyongzhinan.php)): **13.7 m** millimeter telescope.  <br>
   **Band**: 85-115 GHz <br>
   **Line observation**: a bandwidth of ~ 1 GHz and a velocity resolution of ~ 0.2 km/s <br>
   **Time for proposal**: Proposal can be submitted **throughout the year**, but in winter, the telescope is mainly dedicated to the MWISP observations. You may need to ask the staff at PMOD for detailed information about the proposal writing and sensitivity estimation. <br>
   **Notes**: The telescope has a 3$\times$3 beam receiver to speed up mapping observation. 
2. Tianma Radio Telescope ([TMRT](http://65m.shao.cas.cn/)): A **65 m** radio telescope operated by Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO).
   **Band**: 1350 MHz to 50 GHz (currently the X and Ka band, i.e. 8-9 and 30-34 GHz, receivers are not available) <br>
   **Line observation**: Many modes for spectral line observation, for example, **1.5 GHz** bandwidth with **61 kHz** resolution and **8** spectral windows each with a **23.44 MHz** bandwidth and **5.7 kHz** resolution. <br>
   **Time for proposal**: August in NAOC English website <br>
   **Notes**: You may need to ask the staff at SHAO for detailed information about the proposal writing and sensitivity estimation.

### Telescopes in other countries in the northern hemisphere
### Telescopes in other countries in the southern hemisphere
1. Astralia Telescope Compact Array ([ATCA](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/)): A radio interferometer (six 22m antennas) working at **1.1-3.1, 3.9-11, 16-25, 30-50, and 83-105 GHz**. The most extended configurations are the 6A to 6D configurations with up to **6 km** baselines, while the most compact comfiguration is the H75 configuration with **~ 30.6-75** m baseline. The CABB backend provides **16 zoom bands** in a total 2 GHz bandwidth for spectral line observations, each covering **64 MHz** with a resolution of **31.25 kHz**. However, CABB may be replaced in the coming semesters. Note that the sensitivity of ATCA is not very high for spectral line observaiton. The [call for proposal](https://opal.atnf.csiro.au/) is issued in December and June every year. You need to observe by youself after some basic training.
