I am currently a second-year PhD student from the [School of astronomy & Space Science of Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/index.html). My research interests is the molecular chemistry induced by supernova remnants (SNRs), including the chemistry of shock and cosmic rays (CRs). My supervisor is Prof. [Yang Chen](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/Professors/20200707/i113699.html).

Various molecular species have been found in the universe, especially in the interstellar medium (ISM. See [here](http://www.astrochymist.org/astrochymist_ism.html) for a list of molecules discovered in the interstellar and circumstellar medium). Most of them reside in the molecular clouds (MCs), the densest part of the ISM, where the temperature is low and molecules are not dissociated. The significance of studying chemistry of MCs is two-fold. On the one hand, it is directly linked with the origin of life on our earth - the chemistry in our solar system may be inherited from the natal MC (see relevant review in [this paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26ARv..20...56C/abstract)). On the other hand, the chemistry of specific species is tracer of different physical processes, for example, SiO is a tracer of shocked gas. Understanding these chemical processes gives us another view of astrophysics. <br>
