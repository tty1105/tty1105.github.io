I am currently a second-year PhD student from the [School of astronomy & Space Science of Nanjing University](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/index.html). My supervisor is Prof. [Yang Chen](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/Professors/20200707/i113699.html). My research interests is the molecular chemistry induced by supernova remnants (SNRs), including the chemistry of shock and cosmic rays (CRs). I mainly use milimeter/submilimeter telescope to observe the molecular clouds associated with SNRs, and conduct chemical simulations to understand the detailed chemical processes. If you have any questions, or want to collaborate with me, please do not hesitate to email me (**tianyu.tu1105 at outlook.com** or **tianyutu at smail.nju.edu.cn**) <br>
