In this paper, we present our new observation in W-band with the Yebes 40m telescope SNR W51C. We find that the C2H/CO and o-c-C3H2/CO abundance ratios are enhanced by an order of magnitude in the J-shocked gas compared with unshocked gas. Qualitatively, this could be due to the enhanced C+ and C abundance during the re-formation of molecular gas behind J-shock. This can be reproduced by the Paris-Durham shock code with both irradiated and non-irradiated shock.
