In this paper, we present our new observation of HCO+, HCN, and HNC 1-0 line towards SNR W28, as well as some archival data. We find that the HCO+/CO abundance ratio is enhanced by an order of magnitude in the shocked gas compared with unshocked gas. This can be explained by the Paris-Durham shock code. We also investigate how enhanced CR ionization rate affects the HCO+/N2H+ abundance ratio.
