In this paper, we present HCO+ and HCN observations, supplemented by data of CO isotopes, towards 13 SNRs where SNR-MC interaction has been proposed. We find 8 SNRs with strong HCO+ emission. We detect an expanding CO shell associated with SNR G9.7-0.0, as well as a possible line wing towards SNR CTB109. We also explore the I(HCO+)/I(HCN) line ratio and N(HCO+)/N(CO) abundance ratio towards the SNRs, but we do not find significant deviation from the typical values in Galactic quiescent MCs.
